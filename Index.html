				   <li>1941-Tries to enroll in the millitary after the pearl Habour attack, but is rejected. Instead, the millitary asked is lab to work on waterproof  glue , <br>
				   DDT to control malaria, disinfectants and other applied science.</li>
				  <li>1942-Receives a Ph.D  in Genetics and plant pathology</li>
				  <li>1944-Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont , leaves behind his pregnant wife, and files to Mexicon to head a new plant pathology program.<br>
				  over  the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat-including different varieties for each major climate on earth .</li>
				   <li>1945-Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season , doubling wheat yields</li>
				   <li>1953- Crosses a short, study dwarf breed of wheat with a high -yielding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilers, <br>
				   it goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's  wheat.</li>
				      <li>1962-Visits Delhi and brings his high yielding strains of wheat to the indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br>
					  and expanding population</li>
					    <li> 1970- receives the Nobel peace prize</li>
						<li> 1983-helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields </li>
						<li>1984-becomes  a distinguished professor at Texas A&M university</li>
						<li>2005-state "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."Aruges that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet  the demand," <br>
						as we run out of arable land .Says that  GM crops are not inherently dangerous because"we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long <br>
						time .Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breed."</li>
						<li> 2009-dies at the age of 95.</li>
						</ul>
			
						<p> "Borlaug's life and achivement are testimony to the far -reaching contribution<br>
						that one man's towering intellect ,persistence and scientific vision can make to<br>
						human peace and progress."</p><br>
